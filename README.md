 ### Project Description

This was a collaborative project  undertaken by Naksh Jain Sonigara and Pavan Yadav. Our focus was on developing a Canteen Management System for Chikitsak Samuhas Patakar Varde College Canteen.

To gather insights and understand the operational processes of canteen management, we visited the college canteen and conducted thorough research. Our objective was to identify areas where VBA could be implemented to automate various tasks.

Attached to this project are the Macros Enabled Excel Workbook and a detailed design document that elucidates the structure and usage of the system and provide a detailed project overview.

### Key Features
*	**Registration**: Upon launching the system, users are prompted to register, providing essential details for identification and access purposes.
*	**Menu Selection**: The CMS offers a user-friendly interface for customers to browse the canteen's menu, select items of their choice, and place orders seamlessly.
*	**Payment Processing**: Once orders are confirmed, the CMS facilitates secure and efficient payment processing, allowing users to settle bills conveniently.
*	**Bill Generation**: After successful payment, the system generates detailed bills, providing customers with transparent breakdowns of their orders and expenses.
*	**Team Operations**: Behind the scenes, canteen staff utilize the CMS to manage orders process payments, and ensure smooth operations.
*	**Report Generation**: The CMS empowers administrators to generate comprehensive reports on sales, inventory, and other key metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making and performance evaluation.


## Important Notices And Requirements


### System Compatibility for Email System 
Our VBA project includes an email system feature that allows users to send report generated via emails directly from the application. 

Please note that the email system may not work on all systems and environments. Users must have ActiveX Component Object Creation (such as Microsoft Outlook or another email client) enabled on their system for the email functionality to work properly.

### Payment Feature
Additionally, our system offers a payment feature that allows users to make payments. When prompted, clicking "Yes" will initiate the payment process. For testing purposes, clicking "No" will simulate the process without making an actual payment.

Please refer to the [Documentation](Documentation.pdf) for more detailed information on the email system, payment feature, and other functionalities.
